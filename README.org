This is my personal configuration for a custom Desktop Environment, including useful scripts and a list of all the programs I use.

Here are the details of my setup:
- *Distro*: [[https://www.debian.org/][Debian]] - Since Debian Bullseye 11 is around the corner I decided to jump on board.
- *WM*: [[https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm][BSPWM]], [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][EXWM]] - BSPWM is my main tiling window manager. Also playing with Emacs as a window manager occasionally.
- *DM*: [[https://github.com/lightdm][LightDM]] - Simple display manager with easy setup.
- *Shell*: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/bash][Bash]], [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dash][dash]] - Bash is my =$SHELL= but =/bin/sh= is linked to dash for speed of execution.
- *Terminal*: [[http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html][URxvt]], [[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm][Vterm]] - URxvt is my main terminal emulator, Vterm inside Emacs.
- *Panel*: [[https://github.com/polybar/polybar][Polybar]] - Minimal and customizable bar written in C++.
- *Compositor*: [[https://github.com/yshui/picom][Picom]] - Helps remove screentearing and adds transparency.
- *Notifications*: [[https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst][Dunst]] - Minimal and easy to setup notification daemon.
- *Launcher*: [[https://github.com/davatorium/rofi][Rofi]] - Run prompt and dmenu alternative to use with scripts.
- *Hotkeys*: [[https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd][SXHKD]] - Minimal hotkey daemon.
- *Text Editor*: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs][Emacs]], [[https://www.vim.org][Vim]] - Fell in love with Emacs, slowly transitioning to doing everything inside Emacs. Previously a Vim user.
- *Music Player*: [[https://github.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/MPD][MPD]] - Music player daemon with multiple frontends to choose from.

** Scripts
Most of my useful shell scripts are included in [[./.local/bin/][.local/bin/]].

Here are some example scripts:
- [[./.local/bin/rofi_dman.sh][rofi_dman.sh]] is a script to manage devices with rofi. Features include mounting, unmounting, ejecting and listing devices.
- [[./.local/bin/ff.sh][ff.sh]] is a script that uses FZF to fuzzy find files by name, filetype and/or content.
- [[./.local/bin/bspwm_setup_monitors.sh][bspwm_setup_monitors.sh]] is a script that allows hotplugging a laptop with external monitors for BSPWM and Polybar.
** Installation
To install and integrate with your system you need to checkout the master branch and initialize submodules:
#+begin_src bash
  git --work-tree $HOME --git-dir $HOME/dotfiles init
  git --work-tree $HOME --git-dir $HOME/dotfiles remote add-t \* -f origin git@github.com:miikanissi/dotfiles.git
  git --work-tree $HOME --git-dir $HOME/dotfiles checkout master
  git --work-tree $HOME --git-dir $HOME/dotfiles submodule update --init
  git --work-tree $HOME --git-dir $HOME/dotfiles config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
#+end_src
Or you can just clone the repository with submodules and move the files you need to their correct locations.
#+begin_src bash
  git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/miikanissi/dotfiles.git
#+end_src
To install all of my Debian packages (this is a lot of programs) you can run:
#+begin_src sh
  sudo apt install $(< ~/debian_programs.txt)
#+end_src
I use Ubuntu Mono Nerd Font Mono as my main font for GTK, Xresources and Emacs. You can use my script to download and install it for your system:
#+begin_src bash
  chmod +x ~/.local/bin/install_nerd_fonts_ubuntu_mono.sh
  ~/.local/bin/install_nerd_fonts_ubuntu_mono.sh
#+end_src
Elementary cursor theme requires moving icons to their correct location:
#+begin_src bash
  cp -R ~/.icons/elementary-cursors/elementary/ ~/.icons/
#+end_src
Flat Remix GTK theme needs to be moved to correct location:
#+begin_src bash
  cp -R ~/.themes/flat-remix-gtk/Flat-Remix-GTK-Red-Darkest/ ~/.themes/
#+end_src
Vimix icon theme needs to be installed with:
#+begin_src bash
  cd ~/.icons/vimix-icon-theme/ && ./install.sh -a
#+end_src
